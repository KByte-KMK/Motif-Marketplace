    <br>
    We are group InnoCAD from Class 10. We have made this website as a part of our project presentation. 
Motif means a picture or pattern printed on something. It is relevant to the name since our website is aimed at selling quality handmade handicrafts at better prices than the open market.

Our Problem Statement: Limited sales of Pipili Applique handicrafts due to high costs (middlemen taking large cuts) and sales limited to festivals.

This website is also customisable to add more products in the future.

If you have any suggestions, please contact us through the contact page in our website
