In the great designs and motifs of pipili artwork, the motifs of elephants stand out of the rest.
Elephants announce majesty. Elephants have walked over Odisha's art for centuries. From the 13th 
century Konark Sun temple stone carvings to palm leaf manuscripts, they are symbols of strength and order
In pipili, they are reimagined through reverse applique - a method where layers of fabrics are stitched and snipped to reveal the form beneath. Adorned with flared tusks and feathered crowns, you can spot Pipili elephants on umbrellas during Dola Yatra, a march festival that heralds the arrival of spring in Odisha.
